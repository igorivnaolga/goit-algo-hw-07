# Task 1

Write an algorithm (function) that finds the maximum value in a binary search tree (BST) or in an AVL tree.
Use any tree implementation from your lecture notes or from another source.

# Task 2

Write an algorithm (function) that finds the minimum value in a binary search tree (BST) or in an AVL tree.
Use any tree implementation from your lecture notes or from another source.

# Task 3

Write an algorithm (function) that calculates the sum of all values in a binary search tree (BST) or in an AVL tree.
Use any tree implementation from your lecture notes or from another source.

# Task 4

Implement a data structure for a comment system where comments can have replies, and those replies can, in turn, also have replies, thus forming a hierarchical structure.

Also, take into account the following requirements:

Implement a Comment class that represents a single comment. It should store the comment's text, the author's name, and a list of replies.

The add_reply method should add a new reply to the comment.

The remove_reply method should delete a reply from the comment. This should change the comment's text to a standard message (for example, "This comment has been deleted.") and set an is_deleted flag to True.

The display method should recursively print the comment and all its replies, using indentation to reflect the hierarchical structure.
